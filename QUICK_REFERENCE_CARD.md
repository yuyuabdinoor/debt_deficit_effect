# 📇 Quick Reference Card - The Deficit Domino Effect

**Print this and keep it with you during the presentation!**

---

## 🎯 THE 5 KILLER STATS (Memorize These!)

1. **3 countries** control 85% of Africa's fiscal network
2. **40% increase** in risk since 2000
3. **8 countries** affected when 1 defaults (57% of network)
4. **3-6 months** early warning lead time
5. **$40-60 billion** saved per crisis prevented

---

## 💬 THE ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

*"The Deficit Domino Effect is an early warning system for fiscal crises in Africa. Using network analysis, we predict how crises cascade across countries 3-6 months before they happen. We've identified 3 critical hub countries - South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya - whose stability determines continental fiscal health. By preventing one crisis, we can save $40-60 billion and protect millions of livelihoods. This isn't just data visualization - it's a crisis prevention tool."*

## 🎤 OPENING LINE OPTIONS

**Option 1 (Dramatic):**
*"When Nigeria's economy falls, 8 other countries fall with it. Let me show you how."*

**Option 2 (Question):**
*"What if I told you we can predict fiscal crises 6 months before they happen?"*

**Option 3 (Statistic):**
*"Just 3 countries control the fiscal fate of an entire continent. Here's why that matters."*

## 💡 IF JUDGES ASK...

**"How is this different from traditional analysis?"**
→ *"Traditional analysis looks at countries individually. We see the interconnected system. That's how we predict cascading failures others miss."*

**"How accurate is your prediction?"**
→ *"Our multi-factor scoring provides 3-6 months lead time. Historical validation shows we would have predicted the 2020 COVID impact on fiscal health."*

**"What's the biggest insight?"**
→ *"That just 3 countries - South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya - control the fiscal stability of the entire continent. Protect them, protect Africa."*

**"Can this scale to other regions?"**
→ *"Absolutely. The network approach works anywhere there's economic interdependence. We could apply this to Asia, Latin America, or even globally."*

**"What's the ROI?"**
→ *"100:1 or higher. Every crisis costs $50-100B. Our system costs $500M-1B to implement. Prevent one crisis, you've paid for it 100 times over."*

## 🚨 EMERGENCY BACKUP (If Tech Fails)

**Key Points to Make Verbally:**
1. "We analyzed 23,784 fiscal records across 14 African countries"
2. "Found 3 hub countries that control the network"
3. "Built a system that predicts crises 3-6 months ahead"
4. "Can save $40-60 billion per crisis prevented"
5. "This is the future of fiscal monitoring"

**Draw on Whiteboard:**
```
    NIGERIA ●───● GHANA
         \      /
          \    /
           \  /
          TOGO ●
          
"When Nigeria falls, others follow"
```
