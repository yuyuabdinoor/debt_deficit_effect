## 🎓 If Judges Ask...

**"Why network graphs?"**
> "Because fiscal crises don't happen in isolation - they spread through economic connections. Traditional dashboards show countries individually. We show the system."

**"How accurate is the simulation?"**
> "It's a risk assessment model based on trade relationships and fiscal health. It shows potential impact, helping policymakers prepare."

**"What makes this unique?"**
> "Three things: 3D network visualization, animated contagion simulation, and 60 years of historical playback. Nobody else combines all three."

**"Can this be used in real life?"**
> "Absolutely. Policymakers can download reports, test scenarios, and identify vulnerable connections. It's actionable intelligence."
