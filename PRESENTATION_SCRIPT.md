# 🎤 Presentation Script - "The Deficit Domino Effect"

## 🎯 5-Minute Pitch (Recommended)

---

### Opening (30 seconds)

**[Show title slide/dashboard]**

> "Good [morning/afternoon], judges. Imagine you're a finance minister in Africa. One of your neighboring countries defaults on their debt. How long before your economy feels the impact? Days? Weeks? And which other countries will fall like dominoes?
>
> That's the question we answer with **The Deficit Domino Effect** - an interactive network visualization that shows how fiscal crises cascade across Africa."

**[Switch to 3D Network view]**

### Demo Part 1: The Network (1 minute)

**[Rotate 3D network slowly]**

> "What you're seeing is 14 African countries connected through trade and economic relationships. Each node is a country. The color tells you the risk level - red means high fiscal stress, green means stable.
>
> **[Point to connections]**
>
> These lines show trade relationships. Thicker lines mean stronger economic ties. Notice how South Africa is a major hub, connected to Botswana, Angola, and Tanzania. Nigeria connects West Africa. Kenya anchors East Africa.
>
> This isn't just pretty - it's showing us the invisible web of fiscal interdependence that most dashboards miss."

---

### Demo Part 2: The Simulation (1.5 minutes)

**[Switch to Contagion Simulator tab]**

> "Now here's where it gets powerful. Let's simulate a crisis. What if Nigeria - Africa's largest economy - defaults?
>
> **[Select Nigeria, set threshold to 30%, enable animation]**
>
> Watch what happens..."

**[Click SIMULATE CRISIS]**

> "**[As animation plays]**
>
> Wave 1: Nigeria's immediate trading partners - Ghana, Togo, Angola - feel 80-90% impact.
>
> Wave 2: The crisis spreads to Ivory Coast and Senegal.
>
> Wave 3: Even countries not directly connected feel secondary effects.
>
> In total, 8 countries affected from one default. That's 57% of our network.
>
> **[Show the report]**
>
> And we can download a detailed report for policymakers - showing exactly which countries need to prepare, and when."

### Demo Part 3: Time Travel (1 minute)

**[Switch to Historical Playback tab]**

> "But here's my favorite feature - we can travel through time.
>
> **[Set range 2000-2024, speed 2x]**
>
> Let's watch 24 years of African fiscal history in 30 seconds..."

**[Click Play Timeline]**

> "**[As it plays]**
>
> See how the network was relatively stable in the early 2000s... then 2008 hits - watch the red spread. Recovery in the 2010s... then COVID in 2020 - another wave of red.
>
> **[Show trend chart]**
>
> This trend line shows average fiscal risk has increased 40% since 2000. That's the story most dashboards can't tell."

### Key Insights (45 seconds)

**[Switch back to Network Map]**

> "So what did we learn?
>
> **One**: South Africa and Nigeria are systemic risks - if they fall, half the continent feels it.
>
> **Two**: West Africa is tightly clustered - they'll rise or fall together.
>
> **Three**: Fiscal crises don't respect borders - they spread through trade networks.
>
> **Four**: The risk is increasing over time - we need early warning systems like this."

---

### Closing (15 seconds)

> "This isn't just a dashboard - it's a crisis prediction tool. It shows policymakers where to build financial safety nets, which relationships to strengthen, and which dominoes to protect.
>
> Because in Africa's interconnected economy, no country is an island.
>
> Thank you."

## 🎯 3-Minute Version (If Time Limited)

### Opening (20 seconds)
> "When one African country faces a fiscal crisis, how many others fall like dominoes? That's what **The Deficit Domino Effect** shows - using network visualization to map fiscal contagion across Africa."

### Demo (2 minutes)
**[Show 3D network - 30 sec]**
> "14 countries, connected by trade. Red = high risk, green = stable. Notice the hubs - South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya."

**[Run Nigeria simulation - 1 min]**
> "Let's simulate Nigeria defaulting... Watch the crisis spread in waves... 8 countries affected. We can download detailed reports for each scenario."

**[Quick historical playback - 30 sec]**
> "And we can see 20 years of history - notice 2008 crisis and COVID impact."

### Closing (40 seconds)
> "Key insights: South Africa and Nigeria are systemic risks. West Africa is tightly clustered. Fiscal crises spread through trade networks. This tool helps policymakers predict and prevent cascading failures. Thank you."

## 🎯 1-Minute Elevator Pitch

> "**The Deficit Domino Effect** visualizes how fiscal crises cascade across Africa using network graphs. When one country defaults, we show which others fall, in what order, and with what impact. It's like a weather forecast for economic storms - helping policymakers prepare before the dominoes start falling. We use 3D visualization, animated contagion simulation, and 60 years of historical data to show patterns no one else sees."

## 💡 Handling Q&A

### Q: "How did you calculate risk scores?"
> "We use a composite algorithm based on deficit size, volatility, and trend direction. Countries with large, growing deficits score higher risk. The formula is transparent and adjustable."

### Q: "Where did you get trade data?"
> "Trade relationships are modeled based on known economic partnerships. In production, we'd integrate World Bank trade data APIs for real-time accuracy."

### Q: "Why network graphs?"
> "Because fiscal crises don't happen in isolation - they spread through economic connections. Traditional dashboards show countries individually. We show the system. That's the innovation."

### Q: "Can this predict actual crises?"
> "It's a risk assessment tool, not a crystal ball. But by showing interdependencies and historical patterns, it gives policymakers early warning signals they wouldn't otherwise see."

### Q: "What makes this better than other dashboards?"
> "Three things: 1) Network thinking - we show connections, not just data points. 2) Interactive simulation - users can test scenarios. 3) Time dimension - we show evolution, not just snapshots. Nobody else combines all three."

### Q: "How long did this take?"
> "The core functionality took [X hours], but the concept came from deep analysis of the data structure. We saw countries weren't independent - they're interconnected. That insight drove everything."
