### 4️⃣ **Contagion Mechanics**

#### How Crises Spread:

**Wave 1 (Immediate Impact - Days to Weeks)**

**Wave 3 (Tertiary Impact - Months)**
- Broader regional effects
- Impact: 30-50% of original crisis
- Mechanism: Regional economic slowdown

**Example: Nigeria Default Scenario**
- **Wave 1**: Ghana (85%), Angola (78%), Togo (72%)
- **Wave 2**: Ivory Coast (65%), Senegal (58%)
- **Wave 3**: Regional economic slowdown
- **Total Affected**: 8 countries (57% of network)

### 6️⃣ **Data Quality Insights**

#### Coverage Analysis:
- **South Africa**: 21.5% of all records (most comprehensive)
- **Ghana**: Monthly data (highest frequency)
- **Egypt**: Quarterly gaps in 2016 (data quality issue)
- **Ethiopia**: Limited historical data (only 2015-2024)

**💡 Implication**: Risk scores for countries with limited data (Ethiopia, Botswana) may be less reliable. Need data improvement initiatives.

---

### 7️⃣ **Seasonality Patterns**

#### Monthly Patterns (Ghana case study):
- **December**: Consistent deficit spikes (-22,742M in Dec 2022)
- **Q4**: Generally worse fiscal performance
- **Q1**: Slight improvement (post-holiday recovery)

**💡 Finding**: Fiscal crises often have seasonal triggers. December is high-risk period for many countries.

---

### 8️⃣ **Currency & Unit Variations**

#### Observed Currencies:
- **EGP** (Egypt): Million scale
- **GHS** (Ghana): Million scale
- **ETB** (Ethiopia): Millions scale
- **XOF** (Ivory Coast, Senegal, Togo): Billion scale
- **ZAR** (South Africa): Various scales

**💡 Challenge**: Cross-country comparisons difficult due to different currencies and scales. Risk scoring normalizes this.
