# Gamma AI Presentation Prompt - The Deficit Domino Effect

## Copy and paste this entire prompt into Gamma AI:

---

Create a 10-slide presentation for a hackathon project titled "The Deficit Domino Effect: An Early Warning System for Fiscal Contagion in Africa"

**Design Style:** Modern, professional, dark theme with red/orange accent colors. Use network/connection visual metaphors.

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
- Title: "The Deficit Domino Effect"
- Subtitle: "Predicting Fiscal Contagion Across Africa Using Network Analysis"
- Tagline: "No Country is an Island"
- Include: Hackathon name (10Alytics), date, team name
- Visual: Abstract network connections or domino pieces falling

**Slide 2: The Problem**
- Title: "Fiscal Crises Don't Happen in Isolation"
- Key points:
  * When one African nation faces economic turmoil, shockwaves ripple through interconnected trade networks
  * Traditional analysis treats countries independently - missing the bigger picture
  * Crisis cascades like falling dominoes across the continent
  * Recent examples: 2008 financial crisis, 2020 COVID-19 pandemic
- Visual: Map of Africa with connection lines, or domino effect illustration
- Stat: "Risk has increased 40% since 2000"

**Slide 3: Our Solution**
- Title: "A Network-Based Early Warning System"
- Key points:
  * Interactive dashboard using network graph theory
  * 60+ years of fiscal data (1960-2025)
  * 14 African countries analyzed
  * 23,784 fiscal records processed
  * Real-time contagion simulation
- Visual: Dashboard screenshot or network graph visualization
- Highlight: "3-6 months advance warning possible"

**Slide 4: How It Works**
- Title: "Multi-Dimensional Risk Assessment"
- Show the methodology:
  * Risk Score = Deficit Magnitude (40%) + Volatility (30%) + Trend (30%)
  * Network analysis identifies hub countries
  * Community detection finds regional clusters
  * Contagion modeling simulates crisis spread
- Visual: Flowchart or infographic showing the process
- Include: "100 points scale, multi-factor analysis"

**Slide 5: Key Insight #1 - Systemic Risk Hubs**
- Title: "3 Countries Control Africa's Fiscal Fate"
- Hub countries identified:
  * South Africa (5 connections) - Most connected economy
  * Nigeria (4 connections) - West Africa's anchor
  * Kenya (4 connections) - East Africa's hub
- Key stat: "Default in any hub could trigger cascade affecting 50%+ of network"
- Visual: Network diagram highlighting these 3 countries in red
- Quote: "Their stability = continental stability"

**Slide 6: Key Insight #2 - Contagion Mechanics**
- Title: "How Crises Cascade: The 3-Wave Pattern"
- Show the wave structure:
  * Wave 1 (Days-Weeks): Direct partners, 70-90% impact
  * Wave 2 (Weeks-Months): Secondary connections, 50-70% impact
  * Wave 3 (Months): Regional slowdown, 30-50% impact
- Example: "Nigeria default → 8 countries affected in 3-6 months"
- Visual: Animated-style diagram showing wave propagation
- Stat: "57% of network affected in worst-case scenario"

**Slide 7: Key Insight #3 - Regional Clusters**
- Title: "Regional Vulnerability Patterns"
- Show 4 clusters:
  * West African Cluster: Highest risk (65.2/100) - Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Ivory Coast, Senegal
  * East African Cluster: Moderate risk (58.7/100) - Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ethiopia
  * Southern African Cluster: Lower risk (52.1/100) - South Africa, Botswana, Angola
  * North African Cluster: Lowest risk (48.3/100) - Egypt, Algeria
- Visual: Color-coded map or cluster diagram
- Insight: "If one falls in a cluster, all are at risk"

**Slide 8: Unique Features - Live Demo**
- Title: "Interactive Dashboard Capabilities"
- Feature showcase:
  * 3D Network Visualization (rotate, zoom, explore)
  * Animated Contagion Simulator (watch crisis spread)
  * Historical Playback (60 years of evolution)
  * What-If Scenarios (test interventions)
  * Downloadable Reports (PDF-style analysis)
- Visual: Multiple dashboard screenshots in grid layout
- Highlight: "Nobody else has 3D network + animated simulation"

**Slide 9: Business Impact**
- Title: "The Economic Case for Early Warning"
- Show the ROI:
  * Without system: $50-100B impact per crisis
  * With system: $20-40B impact (60% reduction)
  * Net benefit: $40-60B saved per crisis prevented
  * ROI: 100:1 or higher
- Additional benefits:
  * 3-6 months advance warning
  * Targeted intervention possible
  * Resource allocation optimization
  * Regional coordination enabled
- Visual: Before/after comparison chart or ROI infographic
- Quote: "Prevention is 100x cheaper than cure"

**Slide 10: Call to Action**
- Title: "From Insight to Impact"
- Next steps:
  * Immediate: Deploy for IMF/World Bank/AfDB
  * Short-term: Monitor 3 hub countries weekly
  * Medium-term: Integrate real-time trade data
  * Long-term: Expand to other regions
- Target users:
  * Policymakers & Central Banks
  * International Financial Institutions
  * Credit Rating Agencies
  * Regional Economic Communities
- Visual: Forward-looking graphic or roadmap
- Closing statement: "No country is an island. Let's protect the dominoes before they fall."
- Contact/Demo info

**Overall Design Guidelines:**
- Use dark backgrounds with bright accent colors (red, orange, blue)
- Include data visualizations and charts where possible
- Keep text concise and impactful
- Use icons and visual metaphors (networks, dominoes, connections)
- Maintain consistent branding throughout
- Make it memorable and presentation-ready

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Dark blue/black backgrounds (#0e1117, #1a1d29)
- Accent 1: Red (#ff4b4b) for risk/danger
- Accent 2: Orange (#ffa500) for warnings
- Accent 3: Blue (#4da6ff) for information
- Success: Green (#00ff00) for low risk

**Key Stats to Emphasize:**
- 60+ years of data
- 23,784 records analyzed
- 14 countries mapped
- 40% risk increase since 2000
- $40-60B savings potential
- 3-6 months advance warning
- 100:1 ROI

**Tone:** Professional, data-driven, urgent but optimistic, solution-focused
